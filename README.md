# SQL-Challenge
Database Schema and Query Assignment
This repository contains the work I completed for a database schema and query assignment. The assignment involved creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), setting up tables in PostgreSQL, and running various queries to analyze the data. The focus was on ensuring proper relationships between tables and using SQL to extract meaningful information.

Overview
The project was broken down into the following main steps:

Creating the ERD:

I started by designing the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) online. This diagram laid out the structure of the database, showing how the different tables were related to one another. I also identified and set up the primary keys for each table and foreign keys to establish the relationships between tables.

Setting Up the Database:

Once the ERD was finalized, I used pgAdmin to generate the SQL code and create the tables in PostgreSQL. This step included defining the table structure, fields, and constraints based on the ERD.

Working Through Assignment Questions:

After setting up the database, I worked through the questions in the assignment, utilizing the ERD to help guide my queries. I ran various SQL queries to extract data and answer the questions based on the database schema.

Utilizing Resources:

Throughout the process, I relied on previous class activities, peer support, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT to help with troubleshooting and refining my queries.

Key Features
ERD and Table Creation:
Designed the ERD to model the database schema and relationships between tables. Then, exported the ERD to pgAdmin to automatically generate and create the tables.

Primary and Foreign Keys:
Ensured that primary keys were set for each table and foreign keys were used to establish the relationships between them, ensuring data integrity.

SQL Queries:
Worked through various SQL queries to extract data from the database, answering the assignment questions and performing data analysis.

Tools and Resources Used

PostgreSQL and pgAdmin for database management and table creation.
ERD Tools for visualizing and creating the Entity Relationship Diagram.
SQL for running queries and analyzing the data.
ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, Peer Support, and Previous Class Materials for guidance and troubleshooting.

How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up PostgreSQL and pgAdmin on your system.
Import the provided SQL scripts to create the database schema and tables.
Use the SQL queries in the repository to explore the data and answer the assignment questions.
Review the ERD to understand the relationships between the tables.

Conclusion

This project was a valuable exercise in database design and query writing. By designing the ERD, setting up the tables, and running SQL queries, I was able to gain hands-on experience with relational databases. The troubleshooting and use of resources like Stack Overflow and ChatGPT were instrumental in helping me refine my work and complete the assignment successfully.
